You can do the following operation on $S$ any number of times.

- Choose its (non-empty) contiguous substring such that the first character and the last character are different, and delete this substring.

Determine whether it is possible to make $S$ empty. If it is possible, find the minimum number of operations needed to do so.

### Constraints

- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $S$ is a string of length $N$ consisting of lowercase English letters.
